# AI/ML Program Manager: Customer Segmentation and Cross-Selling for Loyalty Program

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the AI/ML Program Manager's approach to managing a project for customer segmentation and cross-selling within the context of a retail business. The goal is to develop AI/ML models for identifying loyal customers and cross-selling relevant products to them, as part of a loyalty program. The project follows a structured methodology that covers the entire AI/ML lifecycle—from data collection to model deployment.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are included in this repository, representing the key documents and frameworks created throughout the project lifecycle:

1. **AI/ML Project Plan & Timeline**  
   A detailed project plan outlining the phases, milestones, and timeline for the AI/ML project. This includes the scope, objectives, and estimated delivery dates.

2. **Stakeholder Communication Plan**  
   A plan for ensuring effective communication across all project stakeholders. This includes communication channels, reporting frequency, and meeting schedules.

3. **Risk Management Plan**  
   A structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks that could impact the project’s success.

4. **Performance Metrics and Reporting**
