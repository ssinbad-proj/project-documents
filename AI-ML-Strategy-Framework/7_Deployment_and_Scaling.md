# Deploying and Scaling AI/ML Models

## Steps:
1. **Model Deployment**: Deploy models to production environments (e.g., cloud services, on-premise).
2. **Model Monitoring**: Continuously track model performance.
3. **Scaling**: Use cloud infrastructure or other technologies to scale the model for larger datasets and higher traffic.

### Example:
We will demonstrate deploying a **fraud detection** model using a cloud service.
