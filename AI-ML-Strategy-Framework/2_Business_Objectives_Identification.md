# Identifying Business Objectives for AI/ML Projects

## Key Considerations
1. **What are the key business challenges?**
2. **How can AI/ML contribute to solving these challenges?**
3. **What measurable outcomes does the business want to achieve?**

### Example Objective:
For a retail business: *"Improve customer retention by predicting churn and personalizing offers."*

Once objectives are defined, organizations should prioritize the AI/ML projects based on their impact, feasibility, and alignment with business goals.
