# Model Development and Implementation

## Steps:
1. **Model Selection**: Choose an algorithm based on the business objective.
2. **Training the Model**: Use the collected data to train the model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Model Deployment**: Integrate the model into business processes (e.g., API deployment).

### Example:
We will train a **KMeans clustering** model to segment customers based on purchase behavior.
