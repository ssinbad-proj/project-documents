# Performance Evaluation and Iteration

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
2. **Precision and Recall**: For classification tasks, balance between false positives and false negatives.
3. **Business Impact**: How well the model meets business objectives.

### Example:
For our **Customer Segmentation** project, we will evaluate the model's clustering performance and its business value in targeting marketing campaigns.
