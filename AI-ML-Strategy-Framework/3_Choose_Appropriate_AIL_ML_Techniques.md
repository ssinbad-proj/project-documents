# Choosing the Right AI/ML Techniques

## Common AI/ML Techniques for Business Applications
1. **Supervised Learning**: Used for predictive modeling, such as regression or classification.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Used for clustering and anomaly detection.
3. **Deep Learning**: Useful for large datasets and complex problems, such as image recognition and NLP.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Suitable for decision-making processes and automation.

### Example:
For predicting customer churn in a retail business, a **classification** model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) is ideal.
